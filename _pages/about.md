Hello, I am Barnabas Szabo, Software Architect, and active full stack
developer.
I am a big fan of the modern SPA frontend technologies (mostly
Angular 2+); Java, and NodeJS based backend (mostly typescript
support) technologies, and the most innovative area: DevOps,
Cloud-Computing, Cloud platform.
